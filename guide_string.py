Hello! 
I am **Apollo**, your minigames partner!

I am here to bring you lots of fun with minigames. First, you need to register using `!apollo register` then you can play the games. So far, I can play **2** minigames which you can play using bet:
- Slot machine `!apollo slot <bet amount>`
- Random card games (every 5 minutes)

I can also give you free 100 coins every 5 minutes. You just need to react quickly when my free coins message appears. Not only that, but also I can help you donate your coins to other players using `!apollo donate @Member <coins amount>`. This donation system can be used **1 hour** after you registered into the game and 5 minutes after you donated your coins to others.

I also own a shop. You can see what I sell using `!apollo shop` command. There you can find useful tokens that can be exchanged with ACNH stuff.

I hope you guys have a lot of fun with me!
Here is my full command guide:
```
- Register : !apollo register
